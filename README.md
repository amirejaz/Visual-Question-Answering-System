# Visual-Question-Answering-System
The application leverages advanced deep learning models to interpret images and respond to user queries effectively. It combines state-of-the-art computer vision and natural language processing techniques to create an interactive experience where users can ask questions about an image and receive accurate answers.

## How it Works:
Let's walk through the main components of the application:

User Input: Users can upload an image and enter a question related to that image. The API processes this input to provide a relevant answer.

Model Architecture: We are utilizing the VILT (Vision-and-Language Transformer) model, which has been fine-tuned for Visual Question Answering tasks. This model is capable of understanding both visual data from images and textual data from questions.

Processing Flow:

The uploaded image is read and converted into a suitable format.
The image and question text are then processed together, allowing the model to understand the relationship between the visual content and the question being asked.
The model generates a response based on the image and question.
Response Output: The application returns the answer in a structured JSON format, making it easy to integrate into other applications or present to users.
